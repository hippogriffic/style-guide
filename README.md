# Incuna style guide

## Setup instructions
**This is a Swig project (http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/)**

- Clone the project
- Run `npm install` and `bower install` to install requirements

## Running
- Run `grunt`
- View `compiled-templates/templates/base.html` in your browser 

## Templates
Make sure you only work on templates in the `templates/` folder, do not work directly on files in `compiled-templates/`; these templates are compiled by swig and your changes will be lost.
